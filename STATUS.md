# Current Status

Current Phase:
Phase 5 — Playback Synchronization

Completed:
✅ Phase 0 — documentation & planning
✅ Phase 1 — desktop foundation (verified)
✅ Phase 2 — realtime foundation (verified: live "Connected" indicator)
✅ Room codes (crypto-random, unambiguous alphabet, validation) — shared/room.ts
✅ Guest identity with localStorage persistence (src/lib/identity.ts, ADR-005 fallback)
✅ RealtimeService extended with Presence (track / sync / state)
✅ RoomService: join/leave, presence-derived member list, deterministic host assignment (earliest joinedAt), host migration on leave, reconnection status
✅ Phase 3 — room system (verified: two clients, presence, host)
✅ YouTube URL/id parsing for all common link forms (shared/youtube.ts)
✅ IFrame API loader — official API, idempotent injection (src/lib/player/youtubeApi.ts)
✅ YouTubePlayer abstraction (load/play/pause/seek/state/events — YT.Player never leaks out)
✅ PlayerPanel in room screen (URL input, embedded player, error surface)
✅ Phase 4 — player integration (verified: URL load + playback)
✅ Playback event contract (load/play/pause + sync request/state) in shared/events.ts
✅ Pre-subscribe broadcast bindings + RoomService typed send/on event registry
✅ SyncEngine: host broadcasts native-control changes; viewers apply with latency compensation, drift correction (5s check, 1.5s tolerance), late-join/reconnect snapshot sync
✅ Host-only controls in UI (ADR-006): viewers see "host controls playback"

Current Work:
Awaiting local verification (two clients: load/play/pause/scrub mirror; late join snaps to position)

Blocked:
None

Next:
Phase 6 — Social Features (chat, join notifications)
